  /* kinds of discounts:
  x = product group of 1+ products
  z = discount

  discounts can be either fixed or a percentage

  Product Discounts
  simple discounts:
  x*(1-z) // 20% off each x
  x-z     // $3 off each x

  quantity discounts:
  min x*(1-z) // 20% off each x if you buy min or more
  min x-z*x   // $3 off each x if you buy min or more
  min x-z     // $3 off if you buy x or more

  bogo discounts:
  buy min of x get x-z*x         // buy 2 get $3 off each additional one
  buy min of x get x*(1-z)       // buy 2 get 20% off each additional one
  buy min of x1 get x2-z*x2      // buy 2 of x1, get $3 off each x2
  buy min of x1 get x2*(1-z)     // buy 2 of x1, get 20% off each x2

  bogo with limits
  buy min of x get x-z*x limit     // buy 2 get $3 off each additional one up to the limit
  buy min of x get x*(1-z) limit   // buy 2 get 20% off each additional one up to the limit
  buy min of x1 get x2-z*x2 limit  // buy 2 of x1, get $3 off each x2 up to the limit
  buy min of x1 get x2*(1-z) limit // buy 2 of x1, get 20% off each x2 up to the limit

  bogo with stackable limits
  same as bogo limits with a stackable flag.

  I think we need these fields:
  productGroup1, productGroup2, discount, discountType (percentage = true, fixed is false), minimum, limit/max, stackable

      // products percentage, highest to low
      // transaction fixed, highest to low
      // transaction percentage, high to low
      // user fixed, high to low
      // user percentage, high to low
      // bogo needs to check value of items.

      /* more accurately:
      1. Count how many products each discount applies to.
        a. get the group number for each discount.
        b. select * from productsToGroups where sku = Product->sku AND groups IN (each discount group number)
        c. TODO: some discounts may not be combined. This should be taken into account.
        TODO maybe we need a super field for things like employee discounts that can be combined potentially even if others cannot.
        TODO super discounts might include a birthday discount off of a sale item.
        TODO maybe we need to rethink birthday money as a payment and not as a discount.
      2. If there are ties
        a. percentages first
          i. sort percentages descending
        b. fixed next
          i. sort fixed descending
