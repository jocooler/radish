Parts of running an api:
FLOW:
a. request arrives at endpoint index.php
b. index.php
  1. requires endpoint Class
  2. requires request
  3. requires security
  4. requires query
  5. requires response
  6. checks verb and requires METHOD.php, returns Method Not Allowed if not found.
    i.    instantiates the request. The request object returns the targets and all details
          a. request instantiates the security. The security model confirms the targets.
    ii.   instantiates the endpoint.
          a. the endpoint instantiates the query and populates itself
    iv.   instantiates the response

1. parse request
2. security checks
  a. check permissions
    1. make mysql queries for user credentials
      a. see if password matches
      b. see if user has permissions for endpoint and method
  b. see if message was tampered with
    1. make sure request and method match
    2. make sure hash from client matches hash from us
  c. ensure the message is safe
    1. check for bad things like mysql attacks
    2. check for sanity
    3. check for length
3. turn the request into quer(y|ies)
4. execute query
  a. make query
  b. retrieve results
5. format results
6. generate page
  a. header
  b. body
7. return page
